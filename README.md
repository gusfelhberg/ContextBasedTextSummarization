# Context Based Text Summarization

This repository contains the files my group and I developed for the final project of the course CMPT 825 - Natural Language Processing at Simon Fraser University where I am currently enrolled in the Professional Master's Program in Big Data.

For this project, we extended an implemented version of a seq2seq model for Text Summarization developed in TensorFlow to allow automatic selection of the best model to summarize the input text. To operationalize it, we developed a Flask application to allow the user to request the summarization in a more friendly way.

Please refer to the jupyter notebook project.ipynb for more details about the project and the files.
