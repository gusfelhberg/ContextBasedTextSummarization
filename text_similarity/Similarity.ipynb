    "Time Warner's fourth quarter profits were slightly better than analysts' expectations. But its film division saw profits slump 27% to $284m, helped by box-office flops Alexander and Catwoman, a sharp contrast to year-earlier, when the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy boosted results. For the full-year, TimeWarner posted a profit of $3.36bn, up 27% from its 2003 performance, while revenues grew 6.4% to $42.09bn. \"\"Our financial performance was strong, meeting or exceeding all of our full-year objectives and greatly enhancing our flexibility,\"\" chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons said. For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.\n",

       "'\\nat the start of a big week for the higgs boson the most soughtafter particle in all of physics scientists in illinois said monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion . the scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than years of research and trillion particle collisions using the us department of energys fermilab tevatron collider near batavia illinois whose budgetary woes shut it down last year . what is the higgs boson and why is it important . their announcement came two days before researchers at the large hadron collider under the alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the cern particle physics laboratory in geneva switzerland . our data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson rob roser a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the tevatron said in a statement but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a discovery . read more the woman at the edge of physics . finding the higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass one of the open questions in physicists current understanding of the way the universe works . the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist leon lederman reportedly wanted to call his book the goddamn particle but he truncated that epithet to the god particle which may have helped elevate the particles allure in popular culture . more science news from cnn light years . the results from the tevatron stemming from the two different experiments suggest that if the higgs boson does exist it would have a mass between and gev about times the mass of the proton . before the tevatron closed the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a fourmile circumference in opposite directions traveling at a fraction below the speed of light the particles would crash into each other creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe . but so far neither the results from the us collider experiments nor from the the large hadron collider located feet underneath the border of france and switzerland have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery . it is easier to look for a friends face in a sports stadium filled with people than to search for a higgslike event among trillions of collisions said luciano ristori a physicist at the us facility . attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the billion european machine the worlds most powerful particle smasher . we now have more than double the data we had last year sergio bertolucci the director for research and computing at cern said last month that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the data are still there or whether theyve gone away its a very exciting time . scientists getting clearer picture of god

authorities said . the florida resident was arrested friday by police in lake mary at about pm and booked into the john e polk correctional facility according to that facilitys website that facility like its website is run by the seminole county sheriffs office . it all came about after zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend his lawyer don west told reporters . whatever happened took place several days ago said west and as far as i know they have not been together for some time certainly not since then . police first learned about it after coming in contact with the alleged victim at a traffic stop on monday lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said . when asked about the delay in making the arrest gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach zimmerman on monday and tuesday but couldnt and was offduty wednesday and thursday it was the officers decision not to pass off the case to another officer gillett said . the incident is the latest legal runin for zimmerman since his acquittal in july on a murder charge in the death of martin a africanamerican in fact its his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend though lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said this alleged victim is not the same woman as in . its clear he hasnt been very lucky with the ladies the last few months west said of his client . judge bars contact orders weapons surrendered . zimmerman appeared saturday morning before judge john galluzo who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into volusia county he was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party but not to stop drinking since the judge said there wasnt any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit . appearing in court is not new for zimmerman who became a national figure in after spotting martin in his sanford florida neighborhood the two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager who was unarmed . that incident and authorities decision not to immediately charge zimmerman spurred largescale protests in april of that year zimmerman was charged with seconddegree murder with an affidavit accusing him of profiling martin and ignoring a police dispatchers request that he wait for police . after a highprofile trial a jury found zimmerman not guilty . that made him a free man but did not end his issues with the law . no charge after other domestic violence claim . about two weeks after the verdict he was pulled over for speeding in northern texas much bigger troubles came in november when zimmerman was taken into custody at his thengirlfriends apoka florida home after the two allegedly had a heated fight . he was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief accusations that he denied he posted bail days later . but after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped state attorney phil archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges . more recently in september lake mary police said that a man claimed that zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident i will kill you zimmerman allegedly said according to police do you know who i am he was not arrested and has not been charged . west said that his client who posted bail later saturday doesnt have a fulltime job implying hes had his struggles since the martin acquittal . its been a devastating experience that hes had that hes working through the lawyer said im concerned obviously as we are here again this morning . cnns christine sever and chris welch contributed to this report\\nzlatan ibrahimovic scored his third goal in as many games to continue his return to form and lift barcelona to the top of spains la liga on saturday night . the sweden striker who was criticized after his scoring streak dried up in the first two months of this year netted the only goal against fourthplaced mallorca to put the defending champions three points clear of real madrid . real can return to the summit on goal difference with victory in sundays madrid derby against atletico . mallorca had won of matches at home this season and should have taken the lead in the second minute when aritz aduriz smashed a shot against the post . barcelona started with top scorer lionel messi and playmaker xavi on the bench while ahead of wednesdays champions league quarterfinal at english club arsenal while thierry henry and gerard pique were also rested . the european champions had a goal disallowed in the minute when young winger pedro rodriguez was ruled to be offside . mallorca keeper dudu aouate then denied gabriel milito and ibrahimovic and the islanders hit the post again just before halftime from borja valeros freekick . barcelona coach pep guardiola brought on messi for andres iniesta seven minutes after the break and xavi replaced yaya toure around the hour mark . the move worked as ibrahimovic pounced to score his goal this season from close range in the minute after pepe luis marti deflected xavis corner at his own goalkeeper and aouate could only manage a reflex block . aouate did well to tip over a fierce messi drive and the inform argentina forward named the worlds highestearning player during the week should have doubled barcelonas lead but surprisingly fired well over the bar . the catalans then played out for time to clinch a clean sheet this season for goalkeeper victor valdes . mallorca can lose fourth place if sevilla win at villarreal on sunday . thirdplaced valencia remained six points ahead of mallorca after losing to struggling real zaragoza in saturdays late match . valencia went behind four minutes before halftime to a thunderous leftfoot shot from uruguayan defender diogo and were reduced to men just before the break when nikola zigic received a second yellow card . the giant serbian was given a rare start in place of star striker david villa but was given an early bath after making an awkward lunge at a defender . angel javier arizmendi doubled the lead with a goal against his former club in the minute after edmilsons fine long pass helped him beat the offside trap and jiri jarosik made it eight minutes later as he stuck out a leg to divert a corner into the net . the win lifted zaragoza four points clear of the relegation zone with thirdbottom tenerife coming from behind to draw at malaga in the early match\\nnobel laureate norman e borlaug an agricultural scientist who helped develop diseaseresistant wheat used to fight

    "in american politics there is strength in numbers when enough people feel a vested interest in the survival of a program it becomes extraordinarily difficult for opponents to dismantle it . obamacare officially the affordable care act looks like it has just reached a critical tipping point while the program still faces many challenges and numerous republicans remained determined to keep attacking the news that million people have enrolled through the health care exchanges is a big victory for president barack obama and his supporters medicaid enrollment rose by million people much of which is a result of aca as well . rather than obamacare being an abstract promise to americans that will be fulfilled in the distant future now the affordable care act is a concrete program upon which millions of american voters will be depending as that number increases opponents of aca will be going after the benefits of many millions of americans not just the president . there is a long history of government programs securing their political strength through sheer numbers . although social security remained a problematic and controversial program between and with some officials wondering whether it would even survive by the time that dwight eisenhower was president there were fewer legislators willing to express such doubts the reason was simple democratic and republican legislators found their districts inhabited by elderly americans who counted on these government pensions and workers who were paying payroll taxes this is why legislators would increase benefits every election year . agricultural supports have been equally strong since being put into place during the great depression as farmers farms and the entire agricultural industry came to depend on federal government assistance to ensure that prices remained stable legislators shied away from trying to fix the program even legislators who represented urban districts had little interest in angering powerful rural representatives and senators whose constituents would not tolerate anyone tampering with their programs . when eisenhowers secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson went after the program republicans suffered ezra taft benson one reporter said when covering the midterm elections has become the democrats fall guy replacing the tired image of herbert hoover . in the years before congress passed medicare and medicaid in opponents including powerful voices in the health insurance industry and the american medical association railed against the plan as socialized medicine that would empower the government to make all the decisions doctors had once had control over but president lyndon johnson and the democratic congress overcame their opposition to put into place these two major domestic programs . by the serious opposition fell away . doctors were depending on medicare to fund their patients hospitals and states were planning on the medicaid budget to keep their health systems going and elderly patients no longer suffered the risk of not being able to seek treatment in their old age as a result nobody really wanted to get rid of these programs . although there were fights to reform medicares regulatory structure and to cut costs since the the strength of the programs has been formidable there has been thus far little possibility that either would be scrapped . the same has been true for defense spending the surge of military contracts in southern and western states during the and became a staple to the economic success of the sunbelt there are many reasons why defense spending is hard to retrench but most important is the huge number of people who will vote and lobby against you if you take a step in this direction . aca is now starting to reach this same territory for this reason alone it makes sense that obama is smiling while the program does not have the tens of millions of people who are in the medicare or social security programs the numbers are growing . aca will continue to face political attacks and implementation challenges but the enrollment level virtually ensures serious debates over repealing aca are now dead\n",

    "i don t agree with your general assertion that men are more likely to support female entitlement or legislation that makes such entitlement possible . sure men are more in power but those men are not free to act in opposition to feminism because they may lose their jobs or not get voted for and so on . my point about the math comment is two fold . i am using that example to show that men in power are not free to oppose many forms of female entitlement and therefore it is not predominantly men who support female entitlement . people are also less likely to accuse women of misogyny and so the women in power do have more of an ability to speak out against feminism .\n",
    "highly educated americans were sold the belief that their higher education would get them a well paying job so that they would be able to pay off the debt . when that didn t materialize it only makes sense that there would be a higher percentage of them with debt . it s not like banks were lending money and giving mortgages to impoverished people . they were targeting recent graduates and convincing them that the american dream is to own their own home . and once you own that home you as well make that loan a bit bigger so that you can properly furnish the house .\n",

    "you would be correct leaving the water in the cooler as this would take longer for the new ice to melt because it would be surrounded by the liquid water rather than the air . this buffer would create a insulation factor that the ice would be able to stay ice longer and therefor keep the cooler contents colder longer . the water however does take up space and it may be more beneficial in the long run to remove all the water to add even more ice but the water between the items in the cooler since water will take up the space between the ice and the items would be a better buffer than not removing the water .\n",

    "there s no listen mode you take plenty more damage and your melee weapons break very easily . combined with the fact you find practically no supplies anywhere the hardest part of the game is using your supplies wisely should i craft a shiv incase a clicker grabs me to get into this locked room or do i need it for a pipe bomb to clear out the clickers in the next room etc . i think i ve found enough scissors for like shivs all game and i m about of the way through . in fairness you still find a fair amount of pills and cogs .\n",
    "in regards to sorin he was and never will be truly good . he is lawful evil . he won t think twice about killing anyone foolish enough to get in his way and sangromancy in general is pretty brutal . he does however have the multiverses best interest at heart just because your evil as shit doesn t mean you can t care the world s ending . take zendikar for example . first sorin ugin and another planeswalker sealed them away . then he came back with nissa ravine and anowan to keep them contained . but you have you delve deep into that story to truly understand sorin s motivations .\n",
    "this happened years ago i was still in grade school at the time i don t know let s just say grade i live in toronto and it s the first time i ve ever really heard of an actual murder anyways it was about a girl who was basically raped and killed and then had her limbs cut up and discarded it seemed like a game to find all the parts of her body anyways that just burned a hole through me cause i thought something like that could ever happen oh my curse my ignorance . oh yah and crack smoking mayor lol also on the whole murder thing saw a newspaper about months ago had a feature on the victim s family still in awe about how the news can t just keep it in the past i m sure the family wants privacy thank you good night\n",
    "indeed i m kind of annoyed that no one else in the comments has a problem with the joke . if you translate the joke naively to code you ll get a generic get twelve of something no language that i know of supports implicit operations on objects or variables that were referenced earlier in code on a syntax level . the only other option is to interpret the language in the joke to either mean get twelve loaves of bread or get twelve eggs and no programmer would interpret the sentence to mean get twelve loaves of bread unless they are separately an idiot .\n",
    "do you enjoy using your ds but want money for the wii u or maybe even a ds in the future i was in the same situation last year . i have a dsi and when the wii u was about to launch i traded in my old wii and lot of other games for different systems just to get the wii u . i contemplated trading the dsi but decided to wait until i wanted a ds because i would rather have a wii u and a dsi than just the wii u . fast forward a couple of months and here i am with a wii u and i ve already purchased my ds xl after selling my dsi . no reason to have it as well as a ds .\n",
    "yes let s move on . or regress and make it ok to call niggers niggers . i don t really care which one we do . all i know is that when i m called a cracker i don t get pissed off because i m being called someone who cracks a whip or corn whichever floats your boat . i get pissed off because the degenerate shit calling me a cracker is most likely adding racist to the insult while simultaneously being racist towards me by using a derogatory racist insult . if i were to say nigger spic or some other racist term i would probably be beaten called a racist and i might even be prosecuted for a hate crime depending on the asshole ness of the law enforcement in the region . it sets a double standard and that s bullshit .\n",
    "phd in a public school here . if they would pay us i d be there in a moment . i only stay in public education b c they actually pay much better than charter private schools in my area . i see the future of education being online or in a privatized setting . the miscreants will overrun the public setting . honestly there are a lot of great learners and educators around . the public school system is still salvageable but it will take a vast fiscal effort on the part of the state s any state lawmakers to begin to offer salaries equitable with what master s degree graduate holders can procure in the private sector .\n",
    "totally agree with you . i would also add that we need to examine why there is a lack of exposure of non white people in the media and other places . i used to intern as a script reader for hollywood for example . of the scripts are written to appeal to young white males . . . hence protagonists are all white males . once i remarked about this to my boss arguing that protagonists can be non white and still appeal to a wide audience . after all i ve related to non asian protagonists in movies even though i m asian . he just shrugged his shoulders and told me they don t want to take a risk like that . don t even get me started on women\n",
    "i think by naturally strong they think that their daily activities give them strength comparable to people who lift weights . most of the time its not true but it depends on their hobbies and occupation . i surf a lot plus i m a sculptor and i have to repeatedly lift at least lbs on most days so im adequately fit without having to go to the gym . my friend is a much better example of this because he builds rock walls for a living so he has to lift small boulders into place and thus has a lot of muscle if not necessarily definition . so you don t have to go to the gym and workout to be strong you just have to have a hobby or job that gives you the rough equal of that workout .\n",
    "if you imagine each subreddit has it s own customs like the difference between north and south here in the states . each one responds differently to different replies . in pics they like to think that there is some semblance of following some of the tenets outlined in the sidebar so they downvote comments like creeii because it doesn t add to the conversation about the picture at all . it probably doesn t help that like me most people who read the number one response and saw that it was a joke instead of an answer were probably peeved and took out their anger on creeii . that s just my assessment .\n",
    "upvotes for you . justamente eso me estaba dando cuenta en estas ltimas semanas . antes ten a re fichado quienes eran k o al menos comulgaban ligeramente con sus ideas . hoy en d a entro leo posts y digo da fuck dude . . . eso no lo habr as dicho hace dos meses atr s . no digo que est bien o mal pero simplemente me preocupa tener una visi n muy parcializada de la realidad y no poder ver realmente para d nde est yendo la nave . antes con este subreddit no digo que lo pod a llegar a alcanzar pero era lo m s cercano sin tener que leer diarios distintos de los cuales no me los puedo tragar otros dos son otro chiste y el resto son . . . meh .\n",
    "well to play devil s advocate i will use an analogy with a cake . if i order a cake from bakery one and its perfect everywhere like the frosting and the cake itself and the decorations are all perfect then the cake is perfect . if i order a cake from bakery and its terrible just for the sake of the analogy but the frosting is mediocre then the frosting is the best part . does that mean though that just because the frosting on cake is better than everything else about the cake that it s as good as cake s\n",
    "here s something that took me years to learn . although you meet lots of players in game you dont have to interact with all of them . you should mainly focus on your own mistakes and improving your play which includes teamplay ofc . it s a choice to communicate with someone . you dont even have to mute people . you should just realise that you dont have to respond to chat . especialy pre it s not as important to win . much rather you want to learn the game . so focus on learning the game instead of trying to win . make mistakes try out stuff learn from it get better . this is also the case with games post and ranked games .\n",
    "i know why you do it i did it myself when i was however i dont think grindr is a great place for a year old . im sure you think your mature enough and what not but emotionally a place that glorifies no strings attached sex is an awful first experience into being gay . maybe you need to come out of the closet to meet new gay people thats what i did and at a party i met a new friend who knew a closeted kid at my school and told me he was gay . other then that your dealing with people bigger and stronger then you who are looking to meet up with younger boys stranger danger and risking statutory rape charges if you use grindr for what everyone else does .\n",
    "the website that it brings me to missingmoney is asking for an ssn in order to see how much i can claim . how am i to be sure this isnt an identity theft scam edit i did some research to see how true missingmoney is as a . com site asking for an ssn is often suspicious . this is just an average ask the internet and not one of them says its a scam this is a blog like site where they try to do a mythbusters type of deal with scam like websites kinda like snopes but for scams abc news story they say its legit they had talked about it on their show and are just confirming that its legit\n",
    "if memory serves graphene was discovered in in they ve finally hashed out a solid way of producing these things . they reduce graphene oxide with an excitation laser orignially done with a lightscribe dvd writer these configurations are as thick as the substrate they re deposited on . the limiting factor now next to go pricing is finding a smooth and flat remember graphene is atom thick so if you put it on a relatively uneven surface your introducing impurotoes and reducing efficency . the issue they re having now is finding a good surface . theres some work being done with thin nickel sheets . sorry for the shit grammer . hammerong this out on a broken phone with a lunch cooling off i front of me\n",
    "nuttyfarts points day ago a year ago i was a loner with no friends and i wasn t invited to any parties and my mum would always brag about how she was a cool kid and was always at parties and telling me how i m an uncool loner and how i need to go to parties . my dad was sick of seeing this and took me to the gym and i started to get in quite good shape for my age and i met some of the cool kids there and they start inviting me to places and i become a sociable person and spend a lot of time with these friends and they invite me too their parties at this point my mum decides i m not allowed to go to parties and tries to cut me off from my friends this made me rebel against her and go to parties .\n",
    "if you re to believe all the conspiracy theories its more likely that ner zhul is dead . throughout the quests in northrend the lich king refers to himself as a shaman . which could mean rather than overpowering ner zhul arthas mind simply fused to it . meaning that with arthas dead either ner zhul and arthas are dead or neither are really dead . also some suggest that perhaps ner zhul is behind garrosh s headstrong attitude given that the lich king essentially set all his army up and garrosh repeatedly shit all over them . coupled by the fact that garrosh really only ever tolerated the tauren because of how useful they were in the northrend war .\n",
    "posted this once before . nothing supernatural rather surreal . i was in switzerland and went hiking wanted to get to the top of a mountain . the weather was shit at the worst point i could see about meters further it was that foggy . i lost the trail and just continued going up wanting to reach the top . i was or . the visibility kept getting worse and worse . then at one point i saw a ray of sunlight then more and more . it kept getting brighter . i looked behind me and realized i was above the clouds . the weather was totally clear and you could see other mountain tops . it was truly amazing . i cried tears of happiness joy .\n",
    "just because we don t know specifically what caused the big bang doesn t mean god did it . there is still no proof of that happening . but if you want to go all history repeats itself trial you can do that . the farther back you go the more god s were the causes of things . prehistoric men felt the reason it rained was because god made it rain instead of water vapor turning to clouds turing into rain . when people recovered from an illness such as a cold back in the days they were fatal it was god who made you better instead of your anti bodies . look up the death of god theory . it s along these lines .\n",
    "there s nothing wrong with not arguing . my partner and i never raise our voices with each other or with the kids . ever . we still sometimes disagree we still have our off days we just ask for space and the other always understands and respects it . we re poly so other relationships are relevant to our situation and being so good at negotiating and resolving issues means we re kind of spoiled for other future relationships . we have high standards of emotional maturity and communication skills now because it s clearly possible to manage things like even my ptsd and the fact that the kids are his but not mine . . . in our two year relationship we ve raised our voices at each other twice both times while we were caring for a dying loved one and in a massively stressful situation .\n",
    "i felt this once and i was really confused at myself . i realized because i didn t know the girl involved but knew what she looked like i kind of caricatured her . i needed to hear what she was like from him and if i could have it would have been better yet to meet her and get to know her . i don t know if this is your problem but it might be . it also sounds like you were hoping to be there and feel left out maybe even more than jealous . could there be some truth to that either way you should talk to her and be really honest . if i were you i d tell her your\n",
    "as a us american it bothers that european companies will be invited to further take advantage of the fact that american workers are not only cheaper than their european counterparts but in many cases don t have the rights and quality of life vacations benefits etc . there are already plenty of european companies producing in the south german and korean car and car part producers all over alabama my home state ikea in the carolinas if i remember correctly and this will only bring more . wouldn t be a problem if american workers weren t mistreated more than their eu counterparts and the environmental policies aren t as stringent here .\n",
    "the curious thing to me is it took me months once to get one of my apps through the app store because reviewer thought it was too similar to the app draw something . my app was called draw wireless . it was a super dinky app that let people iphones connect to each other via bluetooth and draw on a shared whiteboard space in real time . it had a dark blue grey icon with a wireless symbol on it . other than the fact the icon had a dark blue background it looked and behaved nothing like the app draw something . but yet i had to redesign the icon three times and rewrite the app description four times before the reviewer felt i had distinguished enough from draw something and let it through . it took freaking months .\n",
    "could it be the place as well i mean the place where certain type of tourist stay and eat is not the same as let s say family kind of tourist stay and eat . also when you say open . its phrom phong right if you walk to the other side of bts to emporium do you see the same thing if its going to be like but its a brothel . in the middle of the city then i would resort to more anecdotal routine and compare to how ghetto and gangs has become part of urban imagination in america . what i want to say is the openness that tourist feel might come from the surrounding of tourist at that time . being tourist also not limit exposure to other part of thailand . it s not representative of the population .\n",
    "while flyingtac is correct about the fullback and halfback definitions an h back is neither . an h back is a tight end that play off of the los line of scrimmage . the role of the h back is the same as a tight end though in our offense the h back willson will be more of a moving piece in the backfield . willson and miller will occasionally line up on the wing left or right of the tackle and off the los by a yard and be motioned into the fullback position or into the slot or they may just stay put . the h back position not halfback this is different was made notable in the nfl by the washington redskins under head coach joe gibbs who ran a two tight end system .\n",
    "while this is true and also makes it somewhat acceptable morally the fact is that their working conditions are often abysmal and pale in comparison to the wages and benefits we would expect in post industrialized nations . globalization forces these countries to modernize which means that the standards and staples of their previous economy will change making entry into the workforce at one of these manufacturing plants a necessity . therefore the they would be unemployed and starve argument is flawed because that environment is created in part by the pressure caused by globalization and the process of these companies moving their production there in the first place .\n",
    "i think the reason the double standard is there is datsyuk was pressed for comment and he seemed reluctant to answer . when he did answer it was one line . tim thomas was using facebook and the media as a soapbox insisting that his opinion be broadcast . if datsyuk didn t speak the party line he would have been at odds with his church and government . not a good thing in that part of the world . the stakes were much lower for tim thomas . if he supports gay marriage nothing happens . if he speaks out against it he gets shit on by people on the internet and he doesn t even know them . his friends and family likely have the same views as him and he lives in a country with free speech so it was an easy decision for him to speak his mind .\n",
