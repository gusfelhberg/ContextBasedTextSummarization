at the start of a big week for the higgs boson the most soughtafter particle in all of physics scientists in illinois said monday that they had crept closer to proving that the particle exists but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion . the scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than years of research and trillion particle collisions using the us department of energys fermilab tevatron collider near batavia illinois whose budgetary woes shut it down last year . what is the higgs boson and why is it important . their announcement came two days before researchers at the large hadron collider under the alps are due to unveil their latest results at an eagerly awaited seminar at the cern particle physics laboratory in geneva switzerland . our data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson rob roser a spokesman for one of two independent experiments at the tevatron said in a statement but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a discovery . read more the woman at the edge of physics . finding the higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass one of the open questions in physicists current understanding of the way the universe works . the particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist leon lederman reportedly wanted to call his book the goddamn particle but he truncated that epithet to the god particle which may have helped elevate the particles allure in popular culture . more science news from cnn light years . the results from the tevatron stemming from the two different experiments suggest that if the higgs boson does exist it would have a mass between and gev about times the mass of the proton . before the tevatron closed the experiments there sent beams of particles whizzing around a fourmile circumference in opposite directions traveling at a fraction below the speed of light the particles would crash into each other creating conditions similar to those at the dawn of the universe for scientists to observe . but so far neither the results from the us collider experiments nor from the the large hadron collider located feet underneath the border of france and switzerland have enough statistical significance to constitute a discovery . it is easier to look for a friends face in a sports stadium filled with people than to search for a higgslike event among trillions of collisions said luciano ristori a physicist at the us facility . attention now turns to the latest analysis of data from the billion european machine the worlds most powerful particle smasher . we now have more than double the data we had last year sergio bertolucci the director for research and computing at cern said last month that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the data are still there or whether theyve gone away its a very exciting time . scientists getting clearer picture of god particle
cnngeorge zimmerman acquitted by a florida jury over the death of trayvon martin was arrested in florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon local authorities said . the florida resident was arrested friday by police in lake mary at about pm and booked into the john e polk correctional facility according to that facilitys website that facility like its website is run by the seminole county sheriffs office . it all came about after zimmerman allegedly threw a wine bottle at a girlfriend his lawyer don west told reporters . whatever happened took place several days ago said west and as far as i know they have not been together for some time certainly not since then . police first learned about it after coming in contact with the alleged victim at a traffic stop on monday lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said . when asked about the delay in making the arrest gillett said the arresting officer tried to reach zimmerman on monday and tuesday but couldnt and was offduty wednesday and thursday it was the officers decision not to pass off the case to another officer gillett said . the incident is the latest legal runin for zimmerman since his acquittal in july on a murder charge in the death of martin a africanamerican in fact its his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend though lake mary police spokeswoman bianca gillett said this alleged victim is not the same woman as in . its clear he hasnt been very lucky with the ladies the last few months west said of his client . judge bars contact orders weapons surrendered . zimmerman appeared saturday morning before judge john galluzo who decided to bar him from contacting the alleged victim or going into volusia county he was also told to surrender any weapons to a relative or third party but not to stop drinking since the judge said there wasnt any allegation of abuse of alcohol in the arrest affidavit . appearing in court is not new for zimmerman who became a national figure in after spotting martin in his sanford florida neighborhood the two ended up having a confrontation that climaxed with zimmerman fatally shooting the teenager who was unarmed . that incident and authorities decision not to immediately charge zimmerman spurred largescale protests in april of that year zimmerman was charged with seconddegree murder with an affidavit accusing him of profiling martin and ignoring a police dispatchers request that he wait for police . after a highprofile trial a jury found zimmerman not guilty . that made him a free man but did not end his issues with the law . no charge after other domestic violence claim . about two weeks after the verdict he was pulled over for speeding in northern texas much bigger troubles came in november when zimmerman was taken into custody at his thengirlfriends apoka florida home after the two allegedly had a heated fight . he was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief accusations that he denied he posted bail days later . but after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped state attorney phil archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges . more recently in september lake mary police said that a man claimed that zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident i will kill you zimmerman allegedly said according to police do you know who i am he was not arrested and has not been charged . west said that his client who posted bail later saturday doesnt have a fulltime job implying hes had his struggles since the martin acquittal . its been a devastating experience that hes had that hes working through the lawyer said im concerned obviously as we are here again this morning . cnns christine sever and chris welch contributed to this report

cnncentral american migrants en route to the united states face incredibly tough odds . if theyre not tossed from a train or left in a desert they may be cheated or worse . people would tell me well weve kind of accepted or were used to being robbed and beaten and raped photographer michelle frankfurter said . theyre willing to risk all that she said it sheds some light on just how bad things are in honduras el salvador and guatemala . between and frankfurter took several trips to mexico to document migrants journey from the countrys southern border to its northern one . she was inspired by enriques journey a book by pulitzer prizewinning journalist sonia nazario which tells the story of a honduran boy risking it all to reunite with his mother in the united states . i watched these people leave everything behind leave with nothing but a little backpack with a few belongings and then this faith that they have frankfurter said . theres a lot of sadness and deprivation but theres a lot of beauty in it as well she said . she described her favorite photograph from the series no in the gallery above taken inside a makeshift chapel it shows a crucifix a wounded man and several migrants resting on the floor alongside dogs . social media . follow cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . ive been to that particular place a number of times and i never ever saw that kind of confluence of elements together in one single image like that she said everything to me is in that one photograph . frankfurter found people to follow at shelters shed spend a couple days with a group before venturing out to the rail yard and hopping a train . she takes a longview approach . rather than see the current rush of migrants as something like the break of a dam frankfurter has watched the pressure build for decades as civil wars trade policies and a booming drug trade combine to squeeze people from all sides . she lived in nicaragua in the late . i kept thinking that i would see that wave taper off and instead there was just this dramatic spike frankfurter said it seems like a story that just keeps mutating in a way but just keeps on going and that there is no real end to it . michelle frankfurter is a photographer based in maryland you can follow her blog
the whole point of the founding of this country was that government wasnt supposed be a family business but weve got dynasties nonetheless the sixth american president john quincy adams was the son of the second president john adams after all . now theres debbie dingell the much younger wife of octogenarian john dingell running for the seat he announced last week that hell leave after years . thats a record by the way . theres been a dingell on capitol hill every year since since franklin roosevelt was president and there was a depression going on . thats a much better record than the kennedys . there were two years between when rep patrick kennedy resigned and when rep joe kennedy iii was sworn in without a kennedy on capitol hill or any elected office since . so add the dingells on a smaller scale to the bushes and the clintons not a presidential cycle goes by without somebody talking about a clinton or a bush running . its too much for one dynastys matriarch . kennedys bushes clintons there are just more families than that barbara bush said recently . that hasnt stopped her son jeb the former florida governor from teasing a bid for president and arguing his name would actually hurt him . i get the point its something that if i run i would have to overcome that and so will hillary by the way lets keep the same standards for everybody he said last week in new york . jeb bush might or might not run for president but the bush dynasty will live on jebs son george p bush is the oddson favorite to win in his campaign for texas land commissioner this year . there are a lot of smaller political families in the states up on capitol hill take the us senate which has members a full third of them are the father son mother daughter husband or wife of at least one other public official according to a cnn analysis . there are udalls and landrieus murkowskis and pryors pauls and roberts and many more . in the senate politics is the family business . why so many family names in american politics . in recent years on capitol hill weve seen pauls ron and rand levins sander and carl and udalls tom and mark . the brand alone wont win an election but it brings instant name recognition and in this era of big expensive campaigns name recognition can be priceless . some dynasties are harder to maintain than others the liz cheney for senate campaign didnt last long and the attempt to reboot the quayle name foundered when former vice president dan quayles son ben lost his house seat after one term . and the nunns former sen sam nunns daughter michelle is a democrat running in a red state for the us senate seat in georgia so are the carters former president jimmy carters grandson jason is running for governor there . cnns dennis ting contributed to this report

huruma kenya cnn we found barack obamas halfbrother living in a nairobi slum . george obama says he is sure his halfbrother will win the us presidency in november . george obama whose birth certificate shows that he is barack obamas halfbrother lives in a small house in huruma that he shares with his mothers extended family far away from the presidential campaign circus . in his memoir dreams for my father the democratic presidential candidate describes meeting george as a painful affair barack obamas trip to kenya meant meeting family he had never known . in the book which is popular in nairobi and can be found in almost any supermarket obama looks back at his personal story and his struggles to reconcile with a kenyan father who left him and his mother when he was just a child . barack obama sr died in a car accident when george was just months old and like his halfbrother george hardly knew his father george was his fathers last child and had not been aware of his famous halfbrother . i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did george obama told me about why he read the book he came here searching for his roots and i was also trying to find my roots watch george obama talk about meeting his halfbrother for the first time . unlike his grandmother in kogela in western kenya george obama had received little attention from the media . but reports surfaced in the past few days springing from an italian vanity fair article saying george obama is living in a shack and earning less than a dollar a day . the reports left him angry . i was brought up well i live well even now he said the magazines they have exaggerated everything . i think i kind of like it here there are some challenges but maybe it is just like where you come from there are the same challenges obama said . obama who is in his is learning to become a mechanic and is active in youth groups in huruma he said he tries to help the community as much as he can . at least one of his neighbors feels that perhaps the candidate should help the brother . i would like obama to visit his brother to see how he is living to improve his way of life said emelda negei who runs a small dispensary near obamas house . but george obama will have none of it he draws inspiration from his famous halfbrother he acknowledges that he is biased but said he knows that his halfbrother will be the next president . because he wants to be president he said i think in life what you want is what you are supposed to get

cnnsharp angles fragmented glass scaffolding bright lights looming robotics these elements tower over ghostly apparitionlike people scurrying to and from their destinations . in these images amid bustling city of tokyo the overflow of people looks almost like rushing water no more than a fleeting presence . in a generation where photographs are taken to establish a persons presence marking where they are where theyve been and whom they were with photographer matthew pillsburys work takes a different approach the people in his work have an evanescent quality . the fact that the static elements the city the spaces remain sharp but the people are the ones fading it certainly is something that makes us question how our time is finite and how are we spending that time says pillsbury . it is this very transient otherworldly aspect of photography thats captivated him . when using longer exposures im also capturing something that is only visible in a photograph but yet we know it to be fundamentally true . pillsbury born to american parents in france has had a deepseated love for cultural exchange and expressing that through the medium of photography this art form he says allows him to capture a given period of time in a single image and in doing so it allows us a reflection thats just a different experience . reflection is exactly what pillsbury has been achieving with his work for over the past decade on crowded city streets a long exposure will only capture those who stand still for a moment with the clear implications of mortality in his imagery pillsbury stresses the importance of asking questions with his art as opposed to offering a solution or supplying answers . many of his previous works have focused on the use of technology in modern life and our interaction with humanity as a result the project tokyo which was recently featured in the benrubi gallery in new york took a different look at technology as the landscape in which people move around . what drew pillsbury to tokyo was the dichotomy of a culture that was caught in a dance between past and present holding onto traditions ancient temples festivals and ceremonies while embracing technology and modernism . places like robot bar are standard in the city pillsbury describes the scene as a restaurant mixed with a rock concert and a nightclub this loud boisterous environment is a magnet for the younger generations . yet the older customs and generations still have a large influence the two worlds collide when the cherry blossoms bloom . when the winter breaks and warm air is ushered in and the first cherry blossoms bloom an announcement goes out in the paper marking the countdown till full bloom and then the city stops everything else to focus with eager anticipation on preparing for the festivities . during full bloom all generations are accounted for out meandering on sidewalks and picnicking on the lawn throngs of people are greeted by lanterns hanging from scaffolding at the first hanami even in the pouring rain the festivities continue and as the blossoms fall from the trees people stop to clap those that stop to soak in the moment are the only ones that appear sharp in pillsburys photographs . when capturing moments like this pillsbury is guided by the available light what i love about using long exposures is that there is only so much i can anticipate about what the actual result is going to look like and the fact that i still am often surprised by the result is part of the magic to me . social media . follow cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . the element of surprise makes a shot more compelling for pillsbury reacting to the reality around him instead of forcing his ideas onto the landscape . while most of photography is about asserting a human presence the poeticism of pillsburys work is that it echoes our sense of time passing . matthew pillsbury is an american photographer based in new york he is represented by benrubi gallery

the commemoration of ashura arguably the holiest day on the shiite muslim calendar passed without significant violence in iraq sunday . the peace was a marked contrast to the last eight years in which hundreds of people died in sectarian attacks . the period commemorates the martyrdom of hussein the grandson of the prophet mohammed who was killed in battle in karbala in ad his death was one of the events that helped create the schism between sunnis and shiites the two main muslim religious movements . iraqi troops and police were deployed in the streets of baghdad and karbala a holy shiite city where million shiite pilgrims from across iraq converged for the festival over the weekend . no attacks against shiite pilgrims were reported in baghdad and karbala in the last several days police officials in both cities told cnn . abut security members from the army and police were on duty in and around karbala establishing four rings of security around the holy shrine of imam hussein . more than female security workers were placed at checkpoints to search women passing through karbala police said . pilgrims chanted beat their breasts in penance cut themselves with daggers or swords and whipped themselves in synchronized movements from saturday through sunday morning . most people in iraq are shiites and the commemoration of ashura was almost banned under saddam hussein a sunni the first public ashura demonstrations in karbala after his fall in came under attack by sunni extremists . in nearly a thousand shiite pilgrims died in a stampede over a baghdad bridge triggered by a rumor that a suicide bomber was among them . shiites gained the upper hand politically after hussein was overthrown by a usled invasion in sunnis felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop and many backed insurgent actions against the government . as a result sunnishiite violence exploded in the early while fullblown sectarian violence had ebbed by the end of the iraq war sunni extremists continued to launch attacks against shiite pilgrims over the years . paris hilton stirs up a storm in mecca . iraq and afghan vets win in us elections
the european head of consumer goods giant unilever believes that improving the companys environmental practices could help double its sales such is the appetite from customers from sustainablymade products . jan zijderveld the anglodutch conglomerates president of europe said there was a clear demand from consumers for green products . what they want is products from a company where they know that the company makes the products responsibly he said when they buy pg tips they know that the tea is grown from sustainable plantations they know that the way we make it and produce is in the most responsible way possible . he said the days were gone when consumers were driven by low prices alone the funny thing is that for the consumer good value doesnt necessarily mean cheap . he rejected the suggestion that unilevers environmental focus was simply greenwashing saying it was part of our european heritage to build a decent business that is rooted in society and does the right thing . while cynics might doubt the companys ability to make good on ambitious plans to double the business while halving its environmental footprint he believed unilever could be a worldleading example of corporate responsibility . we will prove to the world that this is the right plan and this is also the right sustainable plan for business . read also bt ceo smartphones and tablets transforming workplace . while the company had strong global credentials having operated in asia for more than a century it had recently been extending further into emerging markets such as russia . as a global enterprise we really have to look at where the opportunities are and that is where the people are where the population growth is where the economies are growing and the consumption is still low he said . he saw opportunities for the future in russia china vietnam pakistan bangladesh as well as in african markets because in many of these countries the consumption is lower they are not consuming many of the fastmoving consumer goods we sell . the emerging markets compared favorably to europe in their attitudes toward business he said . the environment is much more probusiness they understand that business is a force for good business generates new products it generates jobs it pays taxes he said it is a lot easier to do business in the emerging world it is a lot more proactive it is less bureaucratic . he felt there was too much negativism towards business in europe and said he would like to see a cultural and policy shift to create a more dynamic innovative business sector . to get the innovation through takes too long to get approvals through takes too long so things are just too slow and too bureaucratic he said if we want to reinvent this continent and make it creative growing and dynamic you need to loosen it up a little give it some fresh air europe needs a little bit of a spring clean to be able to innovate again and grow again

for many children fighting cancer it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments . twoyearold sisi johnson has neuroblastoma and must travel as much as six times a week to rady childrens hospital in san diego but her mother doesnt have a car and sisis compromised immune system means public transportation is offlimits . thats where richard nares comes in . nares who lost his son emilio to cancer in started a program called ride with emilio to provide transportation for lowincome families and their children battling cancer . no child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation nares says . sisi is now one of hundreds of patients who receive free rides to and from treatments . they help me out so much says silvia johnson sisis single mother of two who receives eight to rides per week theyre very clean theyre sanitized they are always organized and on time i dont know what i would do without them . nares knows firsthand what these families are going through in march his son was diagnosed with leukemia thrusting the family into a world of constant treatments hospital visits and tests . fortunately he and his wife had a large support system flexible jobs and understanding employers . we had rides to the hospital to bring emilio he said we had our brothers and sisters and neighbors bring us hot meals . but nares met many families along the way who didnt have such support single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments siblings left home alone . nares said it broke his heart . its extremely tough not just emotionally but now financially he said sometimes both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely some dont have an extra to pay for cafeteria food . when emilio died his father decided he had watched too many people struggle he went back to rady childrens hospital where emilio had received most of his treatment and asked how he could help . transportation they said . so nares started picking up families in his old buick . i was going every day picking up families all over the county he said . soon however nares couldnt handle the number of requests that were coming in so he teamed up with nurses and social workers from rady to create a formal transportation program he hired a driver formalized a schedule for pickups and dropoffs and started the emilio nares foundation in . one of the first children nares helped was a boy with a brain tumor who required frequent chemotherapy treatments with no car the boys mother had to leave her home at am and take four buses to get her son to an am appointment . it was over four hours one way by bus nares said and after the whole day of chemotherapy it was the same amount of time back . nares and his foundation stepped in saving them a significant amount of travel time each day . today nares group provides more than rides a year traveling more than miles it operates out of rady and orange county childrens hospital . in addition to the free rides nares nonprofit provides support services and assistance to its clientele many of whom do not speak english nares group offers translation services and an onsite resource center at rady to help them navigate the oftencomplex insurance systems legal issues and medical diagnoses . most of the families that were dealing with are not just lowincome but they are living in poverty nares said . on saturday nares will begin his richard runs california fundraiser to help children fighting cancer he will run miles over days starting in san francisco and ending in san diego . he says his work not only saves childrens lives but it keeps emilios memory alive as well . he really is the force nares said even though hes been passed away almost years its still like hes with me like hes still on my shoulder or still pulling my ear like he used to . want to get involved check out the emilio nares foundation website at wwwenfhopeorg and see how to help
in american politics there is strength in numbers when enough people feel a vested interest in the survival of a program it becomes extraordinarily difficult for opponents to dismantle it . obamacare officially the affordable care act looks like it has just reached a critical tipping point while the program still faces many challenges and numerous republicans remained determined to keep attacking the news that million people have enrolled through the health care exchanges is a big victory for president barack obama and his supporters medicaid enrollment rose by million people much of which is a result of aca as well . rather than obamacare being an abstract promise to americans that will be fulfilled in the distant future now the affordable care act is a concrete program upon which millions of american voters will be depending as that number increases opponents of aca will be going after the benefits of many millions of americans not just the president . there is a long history of government programs securing their political strength through sheer numbers . although social security remained a problematic and controversial program between and with some officials wondering whether it would even survive by the time that dwight eisenhower was president there were fewer legislators willing to express such doubts the reason was simple democratic and republican legislators found their districts inhabited by elderly americans who counted on these government pensions and workers who were paying payroll taxes this is why legislators would increase benefits every election year . agricultural supports have been equally strong since being put into place during the great depression as farmers farms and the entire agricultural industry came to depend on federal government assistance to ensure that prices remained stable legislators shied away from trying to fix the program even legislators who represented urban districts had little interest in angering powerful rural representatives and senators whose constituents would not tolerate anyone tampering with their programs . when eisenhowers secretary of agriculture ezra taft benson went after the program republicans suffered ezra taft benson one reporter said when covering the midterm elections has become the democrats fall guy replacing the tired image of herbert hoover . in the years before congress passed medicare and medicaid in opponents including powerful voices in the health insurance industry and the american medical association railed against the plan as socialized medicine that would empower the government to make all the decisions doctors had once had control over but president lyndon johnson and the democratic congress overcame their opposition to put into place these two major domestic programs . by the serious opposition fell away . doctors were depending on medicare to fund their patients hospitals and states were planning on the medicaid budget to keep their health systems going and elderly patients no longer suffered the risk of not being able to seek treatment in their old age as a result nobody really wanted to get rid of these programs . although there were fights to reform medicares regulatory structure and to cut costs since the the strength of the programs has been formidable there has been thus far little possibility that either would be scrapped . the same has been true for defense spending the surge of military contracts in southern and western states during the and became a staple to the economic success of the sunbelt there are many reasons why defense spending is hard to retrench but most important is the huge number of people who will vote and lobby against you if you take a step in this direction . aca is now starting to reach this same territory for this reason alone it makes sense that obama is smiling while the program does not have the tens of millions of people who are in the medicare or social security programs the numbers are growing . aca will continue to face political attacks and implementation challenges but the enrollment level virtually ensures serious debates over repealing aca are now dead
this congress is going out just the way it began in complete disarray . fourteen months after tea party conservatives ignored republican leaders and forced a twoweek government shutdown another one came close to happening this time because liberals were blowing off president barack obamas pleas to support a government funding measure . in the early morning hours friday obama signed a twoday extension and the senate is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later friday though they have until midnight saturday before the next deadline . for weeks legislative leaders insisted another shutdown wouldnt happen and it didnt but the house was just two hours away and the senate might not cast its final votes until this weekend . another flirtation with another deadline this one after a midterm election that swept republicans into control of the senate offers a grim glimpse at the paralyzing levels of dissent that could come next . republicans dont fear their leadership and democrats dont need their president . after novembers elections when the gop won the senate and expanded its majority in the house party leaders claimed a mandate soontobe senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has pledged that with republicans in control of both chambers come january things will be different more amendments will be allowed centerright legislation will advance . but longclear divisions on the right remain and were evident in the house when republicans many angry that the party hadnt fought harder to block obamas executive action on immigration opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow by the end of the night republicans voted against the measures final passage . conservative lawmakers complained that house republican leadership punted their latest opportunity to combat obamas signature health care law which they fought to defund during the october shutdown and his executive overhaul of immigration and deportation rules . weve seen the same pattern now obamacare is funded now obamas executive amnesty is funded rep steve king riowa said on fox news alongside him rep michele bachmann rminnesota called the vote disrespectful to midterm voters . even if republicans gain stability democrats are splintering . fresh off an election that purged the democrats of many of their most centrist members liberals now more influential within their own ranks have gone rogue saying no to what the white house called a fair compromise even though their bargaining position isnt going to get better . in an extraordinary scene thursday afternoon two of the partys most influential members made highprofile breaks with obama house democratic leader nancy pelosi called the government funding measure blackmail because of its inclusion of language rolling back a wall street reform that democrats had fought hard to win in . meanwhile the partys liberal hero massachusetts sen elizabeth warren declared on the senate floor that it is time for all of us to stand up and fight . obama and vice president joe biden were calling house democrats urging them to support the measure white house chief of staff denis mcdonough rushed into a caucus meeting to make its case . but democrats insisted as they exited that meeting that mcdonough hadnt won many members over . rep jan schakowsky dillinois said democrats need to draw a line now to signal that they wont accept these kinds of deals in the future when republicans will control the senate too and are certain to advance bills with more conservative priorities . if you dont stand for something youll fall for anything rep john lewis dgeorgia said in the meeting . still some influential lawmakers said the government funding measure was a chance at redemption . senate appropriations committee chairwoman barbara mikulski dmaryland said thursday night was an opportunity for congress to break a pattern in which lawmakers have paralyzed ourselves by making the perfect the enemy of the good . we tried to govern on a bipartisan basis she said we reached across the aisle and we reached across the capitol dome
singaporeans dont normally gather in public protest decades of single party rule and an iron hand when it comes to dissent has shaped a somewhat meek public but a proposal by the government to allow more immigrants to come to singapore in the next few decades to make up for a population shortfall has emboldened citizens to go public . on saturday several thousand singaporeans gathered in a small downtown park near an area known as speakers corner to vent their anger organizers estimated the crowd to between and and said it was the largest gathering since postindependence singapore in singapore police told cnn they dont give crowd estimates . at the heart of the issue is a socalled white paper on population recently issued by the government that proposes allowing the population to rise from million to as high as million by in order to keep the economy growing and to keep it a magnet country for business . the government also says foreigners are needed to take care of the countrys own rapidly aging population . protesters on saturday insisted they didnt fear foreigners but worry about the loss of singaporean jobs to foreigners depressed wages and overcrowding that has taxed singapores infrastructure including housing and transportation protesters also say the governments plans will make them a minority in their own country . imagine a place where you can be a stranger in your own home a protester said . like many developed nations not enough people are having babies for more than three decades the countrys fertility rate has been below replacement level meaning singaporeans arent having enough babies to replace themselves this has had a huge impact on a tiny country striving to be a booming economy . the government has relied on foreigners to fill executive ranks as well as to perform lowwage jobs from construction to cleaning while the country is one of the worlds wealthiest it also has an enormous income disparity between rich and poor protesters say singaporeans would have more babies if they were more confident of their economic prospects and that the government should rely less on cheaper foreign labor and improve the wages of singaporeans

last year after cnn readers voted for me to do a story on income inequality i spent two weeks reporting from what was then the most unequal place in america east carroll parish louisiana its a tiny patch of land on the western bank of the mississippi river home to a beautiful oxbow lake called lake providence that lake i found is a stark barrier between rich and poor and a fitting microcosm for inequality across the nation . my goal in reporting on the parish on your behalf was to spark a national conversation on income inequality that could in some small way help push for change . im now happy to report that the level of income inequality in east carroll parish while still quite high has dropped considerably . new york is now the worst . east carroll parish went from topoflist to no . manhattan or new york county has the highest inequality rating followed by borden county texas franklin county mississippi which i visited in for a very different kind of story mineral county colorado and greene county georgia according to census data released on thursday the new data is part of the american community survey and is an average of data from the years to . the census and many economists use a wonky metric called the gini coefficient to measure how income is spread across a particular society or geography a rating of zero means a society is perfectly equal or that everyone has the same level of income a rating of one means that literally all the income falls into the hands of one man or woman east carroll parish had a rating of in which was the most recent data available when i traveled to the parish now its rating is which isnt that much higher than the us gini coefficient which is according to the census . its a big change kirby posey a survey statistician at the us census bureau said of the shift in east carroll parish its also one he said thats statistically significant when you compare data from the parish to the current set . new york countys inequality meanwhile has remained constant over the same period holding steady at about . mind you that level of inequality is still not good the united states is one of the most economically split nations in the world with more income inequality than nigeria or russia the most equal country according to cia data is sweden with a rating of . also theres a lag in data reporting the most recent numbers those released on thursday come from interviews that were taken between and as part of the american community survey so its difficult to get an exact snapshot of this moment . i do however find east carroll parishs drop in inequality promising . its hard from my desk in atlanta to tease out exactly how and why this shift occurred in east carroll parish posey from the census wasnt sure either i left messages with the sheriff of east carroll parish and the mayor of lake providence among others but i havent heard back from them ill update this piece if and when i do . the one resident i could reach was bernadette barrett or sister bernie as shes known locally because shes an irish catholic nun she told me some new jobs including those with a pepper farm and at a chemical processing plant have come to town or are coming soon some people have gotten employed there so thats helping bring people up she said she told me theres talk of a new tomato cannery in town too . the numbers however indicate something else may be at play the rich are getting less rich the average income for the top of earners in the parish was in but fell sharply to only in the data show the average income for the top fell from to over the same period . its unclear what would have caused that plunge . there have been symbolic signs of progress though among them is that locals and volunteers finished painting a mural downtown it features a crossword puzzle with words like believe hope and change it also includes a painting of dede willis a young woman who was featured in the video on the income gap in lake providence which i produced with videographer edythe mcnamee . ill leave you for now with something willis then told us on our visit if one day someone just came and said dede heres a million dollars do whatever you want i would build a huge bridge across the lake and then after a while the rich and the poor are not going to have a choice but to talk to each other . my hope is that dedes bridge at least symbolically is already being built
among the calls for justice in the maryville missouri rape case is one from a familiar guy fawkes maskwearing face . anonymous the activist hacking collective that has instigated cyberattacks on such groups as the church of scientology and the westboro baptist church made a statement tuesday regarding the case of daisy coleman the high schooler who says she was raped by a local football player the case is back in the news after a recent investigative report by the kansas city star raised questions about the way it was handled . we demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of daisys case anonymous said we have heard daisys story far too often we heard it from steubenville halifax and uttar pradesh if maryville wont defend these young girls if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs if justice system has abandoned them then we will have to stand for them . the statement closed with anonymous traditional tagline we are anonymous we are legion we do not forgive we do not forget . missouri prosecutor to seek special prosecutor in teen rape case . a rape case may seem like a strange cause for anonymous which is better known for defending internet freedoms but its not the first time the group has gotten involved in highprofile episodes of of bullying or sexual assault . last year it posted information about the reputed tormenter of amanda todd the vancouver girl who committed suicide in after a topless photo of her led to teasing and abuse at school . anonymous also threatened to reveal names of students involved in the steubenville ohio rape case involving a high school girl who was sexually assaulted by two high school football players witnesses to the crime talked about the incident on social media sites sharing photographs and using degrading terms for the victim . cnn reached out to anonymous for comment via a twitter site affiliated with the collective but did not immediately receive a reply . the group sees itself as a defender of the defenseless it was also active in spreading the word of the occupy movement and making trouble for opponents . who is anonymous everyone and no one . anonymous likens itself to the air force of the occupy movement cnns amber lyon reported in when they see evidence of what they believe is police misbehavior anonymous strikes back releasing personal information about specific officers . gabriella coleman a professor at mcgill university in montreal whos written extensively on anonymous says the group has gotten involved with rape cases only recently . historically anonymous tended to get involved in censorship and social movements she said but because they have no mandates there have been operations relating to any and every cause if theres one that becomes particularly powerful and i would say thats what happened with steubenville then it does become part of the repertoire of injustices they get involved in . if theres a particular perceived injustice the group is more driven to get involved coleman says in the maryville case authorities dropped the charges against the athletes who had been implicated in the alleged rape . but coleman adds theres also a bit of chance involved she said anonymous picked up on the maryville case after a twitter message was sent to an account affiliated with the group it read this is what happens when anonymous doesnt get involved in a rape case with a link to the kansas city star story . the fact that the case was essentially closed may have prodded the collective she adds . basically its case closed she said if it was an ongoing case they would still maybe get involved but it attracts more attention in a situation like this there are still a lot of questions . maryville is the third rape case anonymous has been part of in a year she observes . though anonymous originated out of the website and initially took on activities for thrills its focus has changed in the past few years says coleman now operations tend to be politically motivated and theres even some backbiting if things get out of hand . for example people involved in the maryville project have been critical of the steubenville operation because there was so much collateral damage coleman said . they do learn from previous operations she said though the nature of anonymous is that its activities remain fluid . its difficult to know whether anonymous demands have had any impact on the maryville case but missouri lt gov peter kinder on tuesday called for a grand jury review of the evidence
the parents of slain american journalist james foley said friday the us and other governments will eventually have to negotiate with the islamist group that beheaded their son in august . eventually i think were going to have to negotiate john foley said in an interview on french radio this situation is not going to be solved by military intervention and money alone so at some point in time people are going to have to talk . foleys mother diane agreed that we need to talk with them and that isis needs to be understood by our world . she said in the interview with europe that the us should reevaluate the policies about negotiation with terrorists and foleys father conceded that while a ransom may not have saved his sons life it wouldnt cost anything to negotiate . foleys mother said friday she believed the us government tried very hard to try and free her son but in an interview with cnns anderson cooper last month the bereaved mother said she was embarrassed and appalled by how the us government handled her sons abduction . i think our efforts to get jim freed were an annoyance she said in september . foleys parents have since established a foundation the james w foley legacy fund which aims to support families of us hostages conflict reporting organizations and educational groups and institutions . foleys mother appalled by us government handling of case . and the parents were adamant in their belief that journalists should continue to cover conflict around the world to reveal atrocities . if we allow the terrorists to prevent journalists from going into these areas then atrocities continue and the world is unaware we look the other way and evil continues john foley said in the interview so we need the world community to come together to try and answer this challenge
the norse god of thunder makes his bigscreen debut in the latest marvel movie the first of three heading our way this summer portents are good for future developments but director kenneth branagh makes heavy weather of the back story . if youre not up on your viking mythology thor is the guy with the hammer and the tempestuous temper in stan lees resurrection his father odin punished thors recklessness by condemning him to a double life as dr donald blake a physician who would pick up the cudgel when evil threatened mankind . the movie gives us a brand new deity who is also a bit of both . the story teetertotters between the exiled thor crashlanding in new mexico where hes immediately run over by natalie portmans stormchasing astrophysicist jane and asgard where he vies with halfbrother loki tom hiddleston to vanquish the ice giants not a hockey team and win the respect of their father anthony hopkins gamely trying to inject some learlike gravitas while modeling an eye patch and several bespoke bronze helmets . an unholy combination of a vegas penthouse and disney palazzo asgard is a computergenerated valhalla with gold fixtures and diaphanous walls revealing hubblesque views of the cosmos a vast waterfall drains out into space and an electric highway allows the gods to drop in on any of the nine realms one of which is earth the stereoscopic scenery is impressive but the screenwriters have a tin ear for godspeak settling for something between shakespeare and the mighty morphin power rangers . presumably this is why marvel turned the reins over to ken branagh whose credentials include hamlet henry v and much ado about nothing branagh has a penchant for backslapping bluster and bravado as well as the kind of kinky cameraangles that make you wonder if someones tripod has lost a leg which pretty well describes the movies exhaustingly lopsided first act . thor is on much safer ground here on earth the tone is immediately different more relaxed comic not cosmic as jane and her colleagues a wisecracking kat dennings and mistrustful stellan skarsgard figure out whether the blond muscle man who fell to earth is a lunatic or a miracle . in this incarnation thor has lost his power tool the hammer affectionately known as mjolnir but he has kept his wits about him and takes his new circumstances in his stride . ireport natalie portman should give her oscar back . beefy australian newcomer chris hemsworth seems to be channeling the young branagh in his portrait of an impetuous gallant alpha male burning to be king theres no finesse in the performance but broad strokes are all it takes the other actors just bounce off him and the movie finds its sense of fun . but it never settles for long all the substantial plotting takes place on the astral plane in asgard the new mexico episodes feel like a sideshow . ireport fans rave for thor . in essence another plank in the elaborate foundation work for the forthcoming avengers movie what thor sorely lacks is a center of gravity on the other hand it is as spectacular as million can buy and very much at the milder end of the spectrum it should hook legions of kids who can look forward to years more thor probably bigger and better in the future
heikki kovalainen prevented practice for the inaugural abu dhabi grand prix from being an allbritish affair as he topped the timesheets after the second session . with three minutes of the session remaining and with lewis hamilton poised to edge out jenson button at the top of the standings kovalainen ensured it would be a mclaren onetwo rather than a british onetwo that led the way ahead of sundays race . conditions for the second period were markedly different to those in the first as outgoing world champion hamilton pipped new titleholder button by just seconds . earlier as the drivers acclimatised themselves to the new yas marina circuit they basked in temperatures of degrees celsius . it was still degrees when the second session began at local time but on this occasion the following minutes would be played out under a setting sun for the first time in history and ultimately floodlights as day shifted into night . ultimately it was finn kovalainen who led the way with a time of one minute over seconds quicker than hamiltons best earlier in the day . but that was no surprise as the drivers grew accustomed to the track culminating in the finn ending up quicker than his mclaren teammate by just seconds with brawn gps button seconds down on kovalainen . sebastian vettel looking for a small degree of consolation for the year by finishing second to button in the championship was fourth quickest in his red bull seconds behind kovalainen . toyotas kamui kobayashi who is deputising for the injured timo glock was fifth followed by toro rossos sebastien buemi and red bulls mark webber winner in brazil last time out . the top was completed by brawns rubens barrichello who himself has designs on finishing runnerup to his teammate with williams nico rosberg ninth and kimi raikkonen in his ferrari . bmw saubers robert kubica finished bottom of the timesheets but that came after blowing an engine after laps . that is likely to incur a grid penalty for the race as he has already used the permissible eight engines for the season . meanwhile the williams team have confirmed cosworth will be their new engine supplier from next season . after recently ending their contract with toyota ahead of schedule the news is unsurprising as williams have long been touted to again join forces with cosworth after previously working with them in . team principal frank williams told reporters cosworth have impressed us with the quality of their technical team and convinced us their program will deliver a competitive formula one engine . in addition like williams cosworth is an independent company whose owners share our passion for racing and engineering . we believe that working together we will develop not only a competitive racing car for but also a longterm partnership that can take on the best in formula one

police in the northern afghanistan province of kunduz are looking for a man they say strangled his wife after she bore him a third child that was not a son . sher mohammed married his wife storay four years ago police said . the couple had three daughters the last of whom was born three months ago said khanabad district police chief sufi habib . after the youngest daughter was born mohammed blamed his wife for not being able to deliver a boy habib said . finally on saturday the man with the help of his mother first beat the woman and then strangled her to death the police chief said . khanabad is about kilometers miles from kunduz city . police arrested the mother wali hazrata and detained her at the kunduz city jail but her son fled . in a jailhouse interview hazrata said her sons wife committed suicide out of guilt . my son did not commit the crime hazrata said but after three daughters storay herself felt guilty and committed suicide . the report comes weeks after afghan police said they rescued a girl who was locked up in the basement of her inlaws house starved and had her nails pulled out . the girl sahar gul was married off to a man last year authorities in northern baghlan province said the girl reportedly was tortured after she refused to submit to prostitution . activists say women continue to suffer in parts of afghanistan despite overall progress since the fall of the taliban . in the second quarter of last year the afghan independent human rights commission aihrc registered cases of violence against women in it recorded cases . in december gunmen attacked and sprayed an afghan family with acid in their home after the father rejected a mans bid to marry his teenage daughter . in another case a identified only as gulnaz for her own protection was sentenced to years in prison after she reported that her cousins husband had raped her . her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize a daughter conceived in the attack she was eventually freed following president hamid karzais intervention . horia mosadiq a londonbased afghan researcher for the rights group amnesty international said the abuse inflicted on storay mohammed is not an isolated instance . generally the human rights situation and particularly womens rights is deteriorating she told cnn i am in constant contact with womens rights groups across the country and they say they are seeing an increase in violence . this is in part because the afghan government does little to implement or enforce the laws that protect womens rights she said . she also sees it as a consequence of women across the country gaining greater awareness of their rights which is leading both to a backlash from men and to more cases of violence being reported . on top of that the afghan governments move toward peace and reconciliation talks with the taliban has led many people to think the current oppression of women will simply continue as it is mosadiq said . we need to make sure that we protect the women its so important that womens rights in afghanistan are nonnegotiable she said . the alleged involvement of storay mohammeds motherinlaw in her abuse is not unusual mosadiq added as women often play a role in violence against other women within the family as do husbands fathers and brothers . and there is a heavy cultural pressure to bear sons who are viewed as the breadwinners she said with the birth of a daughter seen as a burden rather than something to celebrate . if the situation of afghan women is to improve mosadiq said a strong political will is needed at the government level backed up by strong pressure from the international community . where the international community puts so much pressure and focus on a military solution they should also think about the protection of the afghan people and afghan women she said . cnns laura smithspark contributed to this report

the wife of slain colorado prisons chief tom clements told cnn thursday that she refuses to be angry over the news that the parolee believed to have killed her husband was released from prison four years early because of a clerical error . court officials admitted this week that an error allowed evan ebel the man authorities have linked to clements killing last month to be released in january . much like the incident itself i could become enraged for the rest of my days i could be angry that someone made a mistake and didnt capture what a judge conveyed lisa clements told cnns anderson cooper in her first interview since the march shooting . but it wont bring tom back and then my life is in that and my ability to be a good mother to my children so i choose not to make it a focus . the error dates back to when ebel pleaded guilty to punching a prison guard in the face while serving an eightyear sentence for armed robbery and menacing a judge ordered him to serve another four years consecutively but a court clerk entered the sentence as concurrent according to documents and court officials . men questioned as colorado manhunt continues . authorities believe ebel rang the doorbell of clements home and opened fire when clements opened the front door . lisa clements said she and her daughters rachel and sarah are praying for our ability to forgive . i think its not perhaps a point in time thing i think its something we grow into she said . fighting back tears clements wife and two daughters described a loving family man who was more than just his job description . associate of suspected colorado killer arrested . i see him as my dad he was my hero he intervened in my life so many times and he really changed my path i just want people to know that that hes my dad sarah clements said . his daughter rachel said i would like people to see how he lived his life and that is so much more important than how he died he lived his life with such passion and compassion for other people . clements and his wife met at age while both were studying sociology . lisa clements said she was drawn to her husband because of his compassion his desire to help people . at a very early age that was very interesting to me she said . the family told cnn that they are trying to move beyond the actions that led to clements killing . thats due in part to stories clements shared with them . texas da wife remembered at memorial service . often the prisons chief met with victims of crime many told him how their lives had been ruined by violence and they were unable to forgive the perpetrator . but some of the victims told clements they had to move past it they had to live their lives . it would just be the ultimate tragedy if toms life were this horrific end and my life was destroyed by it lisa clements said . she has taken comfort from a passage from scripture that says when darkness overtakes the godly light comes bursting through . that horrific night and the sound of that doorbell and all that happened was just unmentionable darkness she said . i trust that people will see light coming through that they will see a man lived a good life and peoples lives were impacted by that
it was the music of rebellion and youth artists traded witty improvisations onstage chronicling the pain and the promise of being black in america inspiring innercity and rural southern audiences alike in nightclubs and on street corners . atlantabased jaspects fuses rap with jazz in hopes of preserving both genres and appealing to young people . that music was jazz . today jaspects an atlantabased group of young musicians who were born in the hiphop era fuse rap and jazz melodies to introduce younger audiences to jazz and the broader ideas regarding africanamerican society . for jaspects whose music has appeared in the movie hustle flow and recently was featured in the cnn documentary series black in america the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general . veteran saxophonist jimmy heath who has performed with nearly all the jazz greats of the last years says that the music called jazz today began as a voice of the repressed . the history of jazz comes with the history of africanamerican people because whenever they were permitted they always sang and played their music when they were in their own quarters and eventually i think when instruments were available they started to play music on those instruments heath says . jazz was born a raw and energetic rebuttal of what was musically acceptable at the time and became the voice of a generation of africanamerican youth watch as jaspect fuses hiphop and jazz . terrence brown pianist and musical director for jaspects says hiphop shares the same roots . these people wanted to do more than just bach and beethoven they didnt want to play history they wanted to make history brown says i guess when jazz and the harlem renaissance began to give birth people really felt the need to express themselves and that is similar to how hiphop was created . as jazz started to gain popularity outside of black america in the and gained an international following many say the music became distanced from its cultural origins . in his exhaustive work on the africanamerican experience africana harvard university professor henry louis gates jr writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happygolucky air and a ready grin . with the exception of groups such as jaspects jazz today is considered by brown and some others to be a museum piece that aged instead of evolving brown says hiphop is following a similar route and he says a major reason is a lack of ownership of the music . hopefully there will come a time where a lot of africanamericans who do have money and do have the resources take over some of these corporations and not just have the no hit record on the charts because that in itself will allow the community to give back to itself brown says . rapper nas whose real name is nasir jones made a provocative declaration with the release of his album hip hop is dead that the genre is dead because we no longer have the power . at the same time there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as sean p diddy combs jayz russell simmons and jermaine dupri jayz and p diddy who earned million and million respectively in were named hiphops cash kings by forbes magazine . dupri owner of record label so so def records and producer of hits for recording artists tlc usher and mariah carey disagrees that corporate ownership is affecting black music for the worse . they corporations have their input but if you let the money guide you then thats how you let them control you says dupri who released his first book in young rich and dangerous the making of a music mogul . if you are driven by money then the backers that are giving you the money tell you what to do . dupri says that there are not enough african americans who are in control of the music business and that education has a lot to do with it . thats a lot of the problem its always been something that lot of people can get in quick without really doing anything without learning but you have to learn everything about it dupri says . brown says hes hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community . we need to get to a place where we own our own things as africanamericans and a place that the things we do generate money for our own communities brown says not only that but that we generate a sense of culture style and substance for our community . jaspects and groups like them are hoping to change things a little using hiphop the music of rebellion and youth in they are introducing jazz to a new generation to tell its story preserve its artistry and learn its lessons
